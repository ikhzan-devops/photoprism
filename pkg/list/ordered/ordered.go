/*
Package ordered implements ordered associative containers that combine constant
time key lookups with predictable iteration by pairing a Go map with an
intrusive doubly linked list. It ships with SyncMap for concurrent access and is
used wherever PhotoPrism needs to preserve the exact order of user selections
while still addressing elements directly by key (for example, batch photo
editing and ordered REST responses).
