  Prompt: Create a caption that sounds natural and briefly describes the main content
    of the image in up to three sentences for use in a photo management application.
    Begin with the type or number of subjects and action. Omit text formatting and
    avoid meta-language such as "this picture", "the picture", "the photo", "there
    are", "here is", or "a picture of". Use explicit language to describe the scene
    if it helps to properly understand the picture.
