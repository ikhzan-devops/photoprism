  Prompt: Create an interesting caption that sounds natural and briefly describes
    the visual content in up to 3 sentences. Avoid text formatting, meta-language,
    and filler words. Do not start captions with phrases such as "This image", "The
    image", "This picture", "The picture", "A picture of", "Here are", or "There is".
    Instead, start describing the content by identifying the subjects, location, and
    any actions that might be performed. Use explicit language to describe the scene
    if necessary for a proper understanding.
