# PhotoPrism® Repository Guidelines

## Purpose

This file tells automated coding agents (and humans) where to find the single sources of truth for building, testing, and contributing to PhotoPrism.
Learn more: https://agents.md/

## Sources of Truth

- Makefile targets (always prefer existing targets): https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/Makefile
- Developer Guide – Setup: https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/setup/
- Developer Guide – Tests: https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/tests/
- Contributing: https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md
- Security: https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/SECURITY.md
- REST API: https://docs.photoprism.dev/ (Swagger), https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/api/ (Docs)
- Code Maps: `CODEMAP.md` (Backend/Go), `frontend/CODEMAP.md` (Frontend/JS)

### Specifications (Versioning & Usage)

- Always use the latest spec version for a topic (highest `-vN`), as linked from `specs/README.md` and the portal cheatsheet (`specs/portal/README.md`).
- Testing Guides: `specs/dev/backend-testing.md` (Backend/Go), `specs/dev/frontend-testing.md` (Frontend/JS)
- Whenever the Change Management instructions for a document require it, publish changes as a new file with an incremented version suffix (e.g., `*-v3.md`) rather than overwriting the original file.
- Older spec versions remain in the repo for historical reference but are not linked from the main TOC. Do not base new work on superseded files (e.g., `*-v1.md` when `*-v2.md` exists).

Note on specs repository availability
- The `specs/` repository may be private and is not guaranteed to be present in every clone or environment. Do not add Makefile targets in the main project that depend on `specs/` paths. When `specs/` is available, run its tools directly (e.g., `bash specs/scripts/lint-status.sh`).

## Project Structure & Languages

- Backend: Go (`internal/`, `pkg/`, `cmd/`) + MariaDB/SQLite
  - Package boundaries: Code in `pkg/*` MUST NOT import from `internal/*`.
  - If you need access to config/entity/DB, put new code in a package under `internal/` instead of `pkg/`.
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 (`frontend/`)
- Docker/compose for dev/CI; Traefik is used for local TLS (`*.localssl.dev`)

## Agent Runtime (Host vs Container)

Agents MAY run either:

- **Inside the Development Environment container** (recommended for least privilege).
- **On the host** (outside Docker), in which case the agent MAY start/stop the Dev Environment as needed.

### Detecting the environment (agent logic)

Agents SHOULD detect the runtime and choose commands accordingly:

- **Inside container if** one of the following is true:
  - File exists: `/.dockerenv`
  - Project path equals (or is a direct child of): `/go/src/github.com/photoprism/photoprism`

#### Examples

Bash:

```bash
if [ -f "/.dockerenv" ] || [ -d "/go/src/github.com/photoprism/photoprism/.git" ]; then
  echo "container"
else
  echo "host"
fi
```

Node.js:

```js
const fs = require("fs");
const inContainer = fs.existsSync("/.dockerenv");
const inDevPath = fs.existsSync("/go/src/github.com/photoprism/photoprism/.git");
console.log(inContainer || inDevPath ? "container" : "host");
```

### Agent installation and invocation

- **Inside container**: Prefer running agents via `npm exec` (no global install), for example:
  - `npm exec --yes <agent-binary> -- --help`
  - Or use `npx <agent-binary> ...`
  - If the agent is distributed via npm and must be global, install inside the container only:
    - `npm install -g <agent-npm-package>`
  - Replace `<agent-binary>` / `<agent-npm-package>` with the names from the agent’s official docs.

- **On host**: Use the vendor’s recommended install for your OS. Ensure your agent runs from the repository root so it can discover `AGENTS.md` and project files.

## Build & Run (local)

- Run `make help` to see common targets (or open the `Makefile`).

- **Host mode** (agent runs on the host; agent MAY manage Docker lifecycle):
  - Build local dev image (once): `make docker-build`
  - Start services: `docker compose up`  (add `-d` to start in the background)
  - Follow live app logs: `docker compose logs -f --tail=100 photoprism`  (Ctrl+C to stop)
    - All services: `docker compose logs -f --tail=100`
    - Last 10 minutes only: `docker compose logs -f --since=10m photoprism`
    - Plain output (easier to copy): `docker compose logs -f --no-log-prefix --no-color photoprism`
  - Execute a single command in the app container: `docker compose exec photoprism <command>`
    - Example: `docker compose exec photoprism ./photoprism help`
    - Why `./photoprism`? It runs the locally built binary in the project directory.
    - Run as non-root to avoid root-owned files on bind mounts:
      `docker compose exec -u "$(id -u):$(id -g)" photoprism <command>`
    - Durable alternative: set the service user or `PHOTOPRISM_UID`/`PHOTOPRISM_GID` in `compose.yaml`; if you hit issues, run `make fix-permissions`.
  - Open a terminal session in the app container: `make terminal`
  - Stop everything when done: `docker compose --profile=all down --remove-orphans`  (`make down` does the same)

- **Container mode** (agent runs inside the app container):
  - Install deps: `make dep`
  - Build frontend/backend: `make build-js` and `make build-go`
  - Watch frontend changes (auto-rebuild): `make watch-js`
    - Or run directly: `cd frontend && npm run watch`
    - Tips: refresh the browser to see changes; running the watcher outside the container can be faster on non-Linux hosts; stop with Ctrl+C
  - Start the PhotoPrism server: `./photoprism start`
    - Open http://localhost:2342/ (HTTP)
    - Or https://app.localssl.dev/ (HTTPS via Traefik reverse proxy)
      - Only if Traefik is running and the dev compose labels are active
      - Labels for `*.localssl.dev` are defined in the dev compose files, e.g. https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/compose.yaml
  - Do not use the Docker CLI inside the container; starting/stopping services requires host Docker access.

Note: Across our public documentation, official images, and in production, the command-line interface (CLI) name is `photoprism`. Other PhotoPrism binary names are only used in development builds for side-by-side comparisons of the Community Edition (CE) with PhotoPrism Plus (`photoprism-plus`) and PhotoPrism Pro (`photoprism-pro`).

## Tests

- From within the Development Environment:
  - Full unit test suite: `make test` (runs backend and frontend tests)
  - Test frontend/backend: `make test-js` and `make test-go`
  - Go packages: `go test` (all tests) or `go test -run <name>` (specific tests only)
- Go tests live beside sources: for `path/to/pkg/<file>.go`, add tests in `path/to/pkg/<file>_test.go` (create if missing). For the same function, group related cases as `t.Run(...)` sub-tests (table-driven where helpful).
- Frontend unit tests are driven by Vitest; see scripts in `frontend/package.json`
  - Vitest watch/coverage: `make vitest-watch` and `make vitest-coverage`
- Acceptance tests: use the `acceptance-*` targets in the `Makefile`

### FFmpeg Tests & Hardware Gating

- By default, do not run GPU/HW encoder integrations in CI. Gate with `PHOTOPRISM_FFMPEG_ENCODER` (one of: `vaapi`, `intel`, `nvidia`).
- Negative-path tests should remain fast and always run:
  - Missing ffmpeg binary → immediate exec error.
  - Unwritable destination → command fails without creating files.
- Prefer command-string assertions when hardware is unavailable; enable HW runs locally only when a device is configured.

### Fast, Focused Test Recipes

- Filesystem + archives (fast): `go test ./pkg/fs -run 'Copy|Move|Unzip' -count=1`
- Media helpers (fast): `go test ./pkg/media/... -count=1`
- Thumbnails (libvips, moderate): `go test ./internal/thumb/... -count=1`
- FFmpeg command builders (moderate): `go test ./internal/ffmpeg -run 'Remux|Transcode|Extract' -count=1`

### CLI Testing Gotchas (Go)

- Exit codes and `os.Exit`:
  - `urfave/cli` calls `os.Exit(code)` when a command returns `cli.Exit(...)`, which will terminate `go test` abruptly (often after logs like `http 401:`).
  - Use the test helper `RunWithTestContext` (in `internal/commands/commands_test.go`) which temporarily overrides `cli.OsExiter` so the process doesn’t exit; you still receive the error to assert `ExitCoder`.
  - If you only need to assert the exit code and don’t need printed output, you can invoke `cmd.Action(ctx)` directly and check `err.(cli.ExitCoder).ExitCode()`.
- Non‑interactive mode: set `PHOTOPRISM_CLI=noninteractive` and/or pass `--yes` to avoid prompts that block tests and CI.
- SQLite DSN in tests:
  - `config.NewTestConfig("<pkg>")` defaults to SQLite with a per‑suite DSN like `.<pkg>.db`. Don’t assert an empty DSN for SQLite.
  - Clean up any per‑suite SQLite files in tests with `t.Cleanup(func(){ _ = os.Remove(dsn) })` if you capture the DSN.

## Code Style & Lint

- Go: run `make fmt-go swag-fmt` to reformat the backend code + Swagger annotations (see `Makefile` for additional targets)
  - Doc comments for packages and exported identifiers must be complete sentences that begin with the name of the thing being described and end with a period.
  - For short examples inside comments, indent code rather than using backticks; godoc treats indented blocks as preformatted.
- JS/Vue: use the lint/format scripts in `frontend/package.json` (ESLint + Prettier)
- All added code and tests **must** be formatted according to our standards.

### Filesystem Permissions & io/fs Aliasing (Go)

- Always use our shared permission variables from `pkg/fs` when creating files/directories:
  - Directories: `fs.ModeDir` (default 0o755)
  - Regular files: `fs.ModeFile` (default 0o644)
  - Config files: `fs.ModeConfigFile` (default 0o664)
  - Secrets/tokens: `fs.ModeSecret` (default 0o600)
  - Backups: `fs.ModeBackupFile` (default 0o600)
- Do not pass stdlib `io/fs` flags (e.g., `fs.ModeDir`) to functions expecting permission bits.
  - When importing the stdlib package, alias it to avoid collisions: `iofs "io/fs"` or `gofs "io/fs"`.
  - Our package is `github.com/photoprism/photoprism/pkg/fs` and provides the only approved permission constants for `os.MkdirAll`, `os.WriteFile`, `os.OpenFile`, and `os.Chmod`.
- Prefer `filepath.Join` for filesystem paths; reserve `path.Join` for URL paths.

## Safety & Data

- Never commit secrets, local configurations, or cache files. Use environment variables or a local `.env`.
  - Ensure `.env` and `.local` are ignored in `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`.
- Prefer using existing caches, workers, and batching strategies referenced in code and `Makefile`. Consider memory/CPU impact; suggest benchmarks or profiling only when justified.
- Do not run destructive commands against production data. Prefer ephemeral volumes and test fixtures when running acceptance tests.
- ### File I/O — Overwrite Policy (force semantics)

- Default is safety-first: callers must not overwrite non-empty destination files unless they opt-in with a `force` flag.
- Replacing empty destination files is allowed without `force=true` (useful for placeholder files).
- Open destinations with `O_WRONLY|O_CREATE|O_TRUNC` to avoid trailing bytes when overwriting; use `O_EXCL` when the caller must detect collisions.
- Where this lives:
  - App-level helpers: `internal/photoprism/mediafile.go` (`MediaFile.Copy/Move`).
  - Reusable utils: `pkg/fs/copy.go`, `pkg/fs/move.go`.
- When to set `force=true`:
  - Explicit “replace” actions or admin tools where the user confirmed overwrite.
  - Not for import/index flows; Originals must not be clobbered.

- ### Archive Extraction — Security Checklist

- Always validate ZIP entry names with a safe join; reject:
  - absolute paths (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
  - Windows drive/volume paths (e.g., `C:\\…` or `C:/…`).
  - any entry that escapes the target directory after cleaning (path traversal via `..`).
- Enforce per-file and total size budgets to prevent resource exhaustion.
- Skip OS metadata directories (e.g., `__MACOSX`) and reject suspicious names.
- Where this lives: `pkg/fs/zip.go` (`Unzip`, `UnzipFile`, `safeJoin`).
- Tests to keep:
  - Absolute/volume paths rejected (Windows-specific backslash path covered on Windows).
  - `..` traversal skipped; `__MACOSX` skipped.
  - Per-file and total size limits enforced; directory entries created; nested paths extracted safely.

- Examples assume a Linux/Unix shell. For Windows specifics, see the Developer Guide FAQ:
  https://docs.photoprism.app/developer-guide/faq/#can-your-development-environment-be-used-under-windows

### HTTP Download — Security Checklist

- Use the shared safe HTTP helper instead of ad‑hoc `net/http` code:
  - Package: `pkg/service/http/safe` → `safe.Download(destPath, url, *safe.Options)`.
  - Default policy in this repo: allow only `http/https`, enforce timeouts and max size, write to a `0600` temp file then rename.
- SSRF protection (mandatory unless explicitly needed for tests):
  - Set `AllowPrivate=false` to block private/loopback/multicast/link‑local ranges.
  - All redirect targets are validated; the final connected peer IP is also checked.
  - Prefer an image‑focused `Accept` header for image downloads: `"image/jpeg, image/png, */*;q=0.1"`.
- Avatars and small images: use the thin wrapper in `internal/thumb/avatar.SafeDownload` which applies stricter defaults (15s timeout, 10 MiB, `AllowPrivate=false`).
- Tests using `httptest.Server` on 127.0.0.1 must pass `AllowPrivate=true` explicitly to succeed.
- Keep per‑resource size budgets small; rely on `io.LimitReader` + `Content-Length` prechecks.

If anything in this file conflicts with the `Makefile` or the Developer Guide, the `Makefile` and the documentation win. When unsure, **ask** for clarification before proceeding.

## Agent Quick Tips (Do This)

### Testing

- Go tests: When adding tests for sources in `path/to/pkg/<file>.go`, always place them in `path/to/pkg/<file>_test.go` (create this file if it does not yet exist). For the same function, group related cases as sub-tests with `t.Run(...)` (table-driven where helpful).
- Client IDs & UUIDs in tests:
  - For OAuth client IDs, generate valid IDs via `rnd.GenerateUID(entity.ClientUID)` or use a static, valid ID (16 chars, starts with `c`). To validate shape, use `rnd.IsUID(id, entity.ClientUID)`.
  - For node UUIDs, prefer `rnd.UUIDv7()` and treat it as required in node responses (`node.uuid`).

### Next‑Session Reminders
- If we add Postgres provisioning support, extend BuildDSN and `provisioner.DatabaseDriver` handling, add validations, and return `driver=postgres` consistently in API/CLI.
- Consider surfacing a short “uuid → db/user” mapping helper in CLI (e.g., `nodes show --creds`) if operators request it.
- Prefer targeted runs for speed:
  - Unit/subpackage: `go test ./internal/<pkg> -run <Name> -count=1`
  - Commands: `go test ./internal/commands -run <Name> -count=1`
  - Avoid `./...` unless you intend to run the whole suite.
- Heavy tests (migrations/fixtures): `internal/entity` and `internal/photoprism` run DB migrations and load fixtures; expect 30–120s on first run. Narrow with `-run` and keep iterations low.
- PhotoPrism config in tests: inside `internal/photoprism`, use the package global `photoprism.Config()` for runtime‑accurate behavior. Only construct a new config if you replace it via `photoprism.SetConfig`.
- CLI command tests: use `RunWithTestContext(cmd, args)` to capture output and avoid `os.Exit`; assert `cli.ExitCoder` codes when you need them.
- Reports are quoted: strings in CLI "show" output are rendered with quotes by the report helpers. Prefer `assert.Contains`/regex over strict, fully formatted equality when validating content.

#### Test Data & Fixtures (storage/testdata)

- Shared test files live under `storage/testdata`. The lifecycle is managed by `internal/config/test.go`.
- `NewTestConfig("<pkg>")` now calls `InitializeTestData()` so required directories exist (originals, import, cache, temp) before tests run.
- If you build a custom `*config.Config`, call `c.InitializeTestData()` (and optionally `c.AssertTestData(t)`) before asserting on filesystem paths.
- `InitializeTestData()` deletes existing testdata (`RemoveTestData()`), downloads/unzips fixtures if needed, and then calls `CreateDirectories()` to ensure required directories exist.

### Roles & ACL

- Always map roles via the central tables:
  - Users: `acl.ParseRole(s)` or `acl.UserRoles[clean.Role(s)]`.
  - Clients: `acl.ClientRoles[clean.Role(s)]`.
- Aliases: `RoleAliasNone` ("none") and the empty string both map to `RoleNone`; do not special‑case them in callers.
- Defaults:
  - Client roles: if input is unknown, default to `RoleClient`.
  - User roles: `acl.ParseRole` handles special tokens like `0/false/nil` as none.
- CLI usage strings: build flag help from `Roles.CliUsageString()` (e.g., `acl.ClientRoles.CliUsageString()`), not from hard‑coded lists.

### Import/Index

- ImportWorker may skip files if an identical file already exists (duplicate detection). Use unique copies or assert DB rows after ensuring a non‑duplicate destination.
- Mixed roots: when testing related files, keep `ExamplesPath()/ImportPath()/OriginalsPath()` consistent so `RelatedFiles` and `AllowExt` behave as expected.

### CLI Usage & Assertions

- Capture output with `RunWithTestContext`; usage and report values may be quoted and re‑ordered (e.g., set semantics). Use substring checks or regex for the final ", or <last>" rule from `CliUsageString`.
- Prefer JSON output (`--json`) for stable machine assertions when commands offer it.
- Cataloging CLI commands (new):
  - Use `internal/commands/catalog` to enumerate commands/flags without invoking the CLI or capturing stdout.
  - Default format for `photoprism show commands` is Markdown; pass `--json` for machine output and `--nested` to get a tree. Hidden commands/flags appear only with `--all`.
  - Nested `help` subcommands are omitted; the top‑level `photoprism help` remains included.
  - When asserting large JSON documents, build DTOs via `catalog.BuildFlat/BuildNode` and marshal directly to avoid pipe back‑pressure in tests.
- JSON shapes for `show` commands:
  - Most return a top‑level array of row objects (keys = snake_case columns).
  - `photoprism show config` returns `{ sections: [{ title, items[] }] }`.
  - `photoprism show config-options --json` and `photoprism show config-yaml --json` return a flat top‑level array (no `sections`).

### API Development & Config Options 

The following conventions summarize the insights gained when adding new configuration options, API endpoints, and related tests. Follow these conventions unless a maintainer requests an exception.

- Config precedence and new options
  - Global precedence: If present, values in `options.yml` override CLI flags and environment variables; all override config defaults in `defaults.yml`. Don’t special‑case a single option.
  - Adding a new option:
    - Add a field to `internal/config/options.go` with `yaml:"…"` and a `flag:"…"` tag.
    - Register a CLI flag and env mapping in `internal/config/flags.go` (use `EnvVars(...)`).
    - Expose a getter on `*config.Config` in the relevant file (e.g., cluster options in `config_cluster.go`).
    - Add name/value to `rows` in `*config.Report()`, after the same option as in `internal/config/options.go` for `photoprism show config` to report it (obfuscate passwords with `*`).
    - If the value must persist (e.g., a generated UUID), write it back to `options.yml` using a focused helper that merges keys.
    - Tests: cover CLI/env/file precedence and persistence. When tests need a new flag, add it to `CliTestContext` in `internal/config/test.go`.
  - Example: `ClusterUUID` precedence = `options.yml` → CLI/env (`--cluster-uuid` / `PHOTOPRISM_CLUSTER_UUID`) → generate UUIDv4 and persist.
  - CLI flag precedence: when you need to favor an explicit CLI flag over defaults, check `c.cliCtx.IsSet("<flag>")` before applying additional precedence logic.
  - Persisting generated options: when writing to `options.yml`, set `c.options.OptionsYaml = filepath.Join(c.ConfigPath(), "options.yml")` and reload the file to keep in‑memory

- Database access
  - The app uses GORM v1. Don’t use `WithContext`; for executing raw SQL, prefer `db.Raw(stmt).Scan(&nop)`.
  - When provisioning MariaDB/MySQL objects, quote identifiers with backticks and limit the character set; avoid building identifiers from untrusted input.
  - Reuse `conf.Db()` and `conf.Database*()` getters; reject unsupported drivers early with a clear error.

- Rate limiting
  - Reuse the existing limiter in `internal/server/limiter` (e.g., `limiter.Auth` / `limiter.Login`).
  - For 429s, use `limiter.AbortJSON(c)` when applicable; avoid creating new limiter stacks.

- API handlers
  - Use existing helpers: `api.ClientIP(c)`, `header.BearerToken(c)`, `Abort*` functions for errors.
  - Compare secrets/tokens using constant‑time compare; don’t log secrets.
  - Set `Cache-Control: no-store` on responses containing secrets.
  - Register new routes in `internal/server/routes.go`. Don’t edit `swagger.json` directly—run `make swag` to regenerate.
  - Portal mode: set `PHOTOPRISM_NODE_ROLE=portal` and `PHOTOPRISM_JOIN_TOKEN`.
  - Pagination defaults: for new list endpoints, prefer `count` default 100 (max 1000) and `offset` ≥ 0; document both in Swagger and validate bounds in handlers.
  - Document parameters explicitly in Swagger annotations (path, query, and body) so `make swag` produces accurate docs.
- Swagger: `make fmt-go swag-fmt && make swag` after adding or changing API annotations.

### Swagger & API Docs

- Annotations live next to handlers in `internal/api/*.go`. Only annotate public handlers that are registered in `internal/server/routes.go`.
- Always include the full prefix in `@Router` paths: `/api/v1/...` (not relative segments).
- Avoid annotating internal helpers (e.g., generic link creators) to prevent generating undocumented placeholder paths.
- Generate docs locally with:
  - `make swag-fmt` (formats annotations)
  - `make swag-json` (generates `internal/api/swagger.json` and then runs `swaggerfix` to remove unstable `time.Duration` enums for deterministic diffs)
- `time.Duration` fields are represented as integer nanoseconds in the API. The Makefile target `swag-json` automatically post-processes `swagger.json` to strip duplicated enums for this type.
  - Focused tests: `go test ./internal/api -run Cluster -count=1` (or limit to the package you changed).

- Registry & secrets
  - Store portal/node registry data under `conf.PortalConfigPath()/nodes/` as YAML with file mode `0600`.
  - Keep node secrets out of logs and omit them from JSON responses unless explicitly returned on creation/rotation.

- Testing patterns
  - Use `t.TempDir()` for isolated config paths and files. After changing `ConfigPath` post‑construction, reload `options.yml` into `c.options` if needed.
  - Prefer small, focused unit tests; use existing test helpers (`NewConfig`, `CliTestContext`, etc.).
  - API tests: use `NewApiTest()`, `PerformRequest*`, `AuthenticateAdmin` / `AuthenticateUser`, and `OAuthToken` for client-scope scenarios.
  - Permissions: cover public=false (401), CDN headers (403), admin access (200), and client tokens with insufficient scope (403).
  - Auth mode in tests: use `conf.SetAuthMode(config.AuthModePasswd)` (and defer restore) instead of flipping `Options().Public`; this toggles related internals used by tests.
  - Fixtures caveat: user fixtures often have admin role; for negative permission tests, prefer OAuth client tokens with limited scope rather than relying on a non‑admin user.

### Formatting (Go)

- Go is formatted by `gofmt` and uses tabs. Do not hand-format indentation.
- Always run after edits: `make fmt-go` (gofmt + goimports).

### API Shape Checklist

- When renaming or adding fields:
  - Update DTOs in `internal/service/cluster/response.go` and any mappers.
  - Update handlers and regenerate Swagger: `make fmt-go swag-fmt swag`.
  - Update tests (search/replace old field names) and examples in `specs/`.
  - Quick grep: `rg -n 'oldField|newField' -S` across code, tests, and specs.

### Cluster Registry (Source of Truth)

- Use the client‑backed registry (`NewClientRegistryWithConfig`).
- The file‑backed registry is historical; do not add new references to it.
- Migration “done” checklist: swap callsites → build → API tests → CLI tests → remove legacy references.
- Primary node identifier: UUID v7 (called `NodeUUID` in code/config). In API/CLI responses this is exposed as `uuid`. The OAuth client identifier (`NodeClientID`) is used only for OAuth and is exposed as `clientId`.
- Lookups should prefer `uuid` → `clientId` (legacy) → DNS‑label name. Portal endpoints for nodes use `/api/v1/cluster/nodes/{uuid}`.

### API/CLI Tests: Known Pitfalls

- Gin routes: Register `CreateSession(router)` once per test router; reusing it twice panics on duplicate route.
- CLI commands: Some commands defer `conf.Shutdown()` or emit signals that close the DB. The harness re‑opens DB before each run, but avoid invoking `start` or emitting signals in unit tests.
- Signals: `internal/commands/start.go` waits on `process.Signal`; calling `process.Shutdown()/Restart()` can close DB. Prefer not to trigger signals in tests.

### Download CLI Workbench (yt-dlp, remux, importer)

- Code anchors
  - CLI flags and examples: `internal/commands/download.go`
  - Core implementation (testable): `internal/commands/download_impl.go`
  - yt-dlp helpers and arg wiring: `internal/photoprism/dl/*` (`options.go`, `info.go`, `file.go`, `meta.go`)
  - Importer entry point: `internal/photoprism/get/import.go`; options: `internal/photoprism/import_options.go`

- Quick test runs (fast feedback)
  - yt-dlp package: `go test ./internal/photoprism/dl -run 'Options|Created|PostprocessorArgs' -count=1`
  - CLI command: `go test ./internal/commands -run 'DownloadImpl|HelpFlags' -count=1`

- FFmpeg-less tests
  - In tests: set `c.Options().FFmpegBin = "/bin/false"` and `c.Settings().Index.Convert = false` to avoid ffmpeg dependencies when not validating remux.

- Stubbing yt-dlp (no network)
  - Use a tiny shell script that:
    - prints minimal JSON for `--dump-single-json`
    - creates a file and prints its path when `--print` is requested
  - Harness env vars (supported by our tests):
    - `YTDLP_ARGS_LOG` — append final args for assertion
    - `YTDLP_OUTPUT_FILE` — absolute file path to create for `--print`
    - `YTDLP_DUMMY_CONTENT` — file contents to avoid importer duplicate detection between tests

- Remux policy and metadata
  - Pipe method: PhotoPrism remux (ffmpeg) always embeds title/description/created.
  - File method: yt‑dlp writes files; we pass `--postprocessor-args 'ffmpeg:-metadata creation_time=<RFC3339>'` so imports get `Created` even without local remux (fallback from `upload_date`/`release_date`).
  - Default remux policy: `auto`; use `always` for the most complete metadata (chapters, extended tags).

- Testing
  - Prefer targeted runs before the full suite:
    - `go test ./internal/<pkg> -run <Name> -count=1`
    - Avoid `./...` unless you intend to run everything.
  - Importer duplicates: When reusing names/paths across tests, the importer may dedupe; vary file bytes via `YTDLP_DUMMY_CONTENT` or adjust `dest` to ensure assertions see the new file.
  - Long-running packages: `internal/photoprism` is heavy; validate CLI/dl changes first in their packages, then run broader suites.

### Sessions & Redaction (building sessions in tests)

- Admin session (full view): `AuthenticateAdmin(app, router)`.
- User session: Create a non‑admin test user (role=guest), set a password, then `AuthenticateUser`.
- Client session (redacted internal fields; `siteUrl` visible):
  ```go
  s, _ := entity.AddClientSession("test-client", conf.SessionMaxAge(), "cluster", authn.GrantClientCredentials, nil)
  token := s.AuthToken()
  r := AuthenticatedRequest(app, http.MethodGet, "/api/v1/cluster/nodes", token)
  ```
  Admins see `advertiseUrl` and `database`; client/user sessions don’t. `siteUrl` is safe to show to all roles.

### Preflight Checklist

- `go build ./...`
- `make fmt-go swag-fmt swag`
- `go test ./internal/service/cluster/registry -count=1`
- `go test ./internal/api -run 'Cluster' -count=1`
- `go test ./internal/commands -run 'ClusterRegister|ClusterNodesRotate' -count=1`

- Known tooling constraints
  - Python may not be available in the dev container; prefer `apply_patch`, Go, or Make targets over ad‑hoc scripts.
  - `make swag` may fetch modules; ensure network availability in CI before running.

### Cluster Config & Bootstrap

- Import rules (avoid cycles):
  - Do not import `internal/service/cluster/instance/*` from `internal/config` or the cluster root package.
  - Instance/service bootstraps talk to the Portal via HTTP(S); do not import Portal internals such as `internal/api` or `internal/service/cluster/registry`/`provisioner`.
  - Prefer constants from `internal/service/cluster/const.go` (e.g., `cluster.RoleInstance`, `cluster.RolePortal`) over string literals.

- Early extension lifecycle (config.Init sequence):
  1) Load `options.yml` and settings (`c.initSettings()`)
  2) Run early hooks: `EarlyExt().InitEarly(c)` (may adjust DB settings)
  3) Connect DB: `connectDb()` and `RegisterDb()`
  4) Run regular extensions: `Ext().Init(c)`

- Theme endpoint usage:
  - Server: `GET /api/v1/cluster/theme` generates a zip from `conf.ThemePath()`; returns 200 with a valid (possibly empty) zip or 404 if missing.
  - Client/CLI: install only if `ThemePath()` is missing or lacks `app.js`; do not overwrite unless explicitly allowed.
  - Use header helpers/constants from `pkg/service/http/header` (e.g., `header.Accept`, `header.ContentTypeZip`, `header.SetAuthorization`).

- Registration (instance bootstrap):
  - Send `rotate=true` only if driver is MySQL/MariaDB and no DSN/name/user/password is configured (including *_FILE for password); never for SQLite.
  - Treat 401/403/404 as terminal; apply bounded retries with delay for transient/network/429.
  - Identity changes (UUID/name): include `clientId` and `clientSecret` in the registration payload to authorize UUID/name changes for existing nodes. Without the secret, name-based UUID changes return HTTP 409.
  - Persist only missing `NodeClientSecret` and DB settings when rotation was requested.

### Cluster Registry, Provisioner, and DTOs

- UUID-first Identity & endpoints
  - Nodes use UUID v7 as the only primary identifier. All Portal node endpoints use `{uuid}`. Client IDs are OAuth‑only.
  - Registry interface is UUID‑first: `Get(uuid)`, `FindByNodeUUID`, `FindByClientID`, `Delete(uuid)`, `RotateSecret(uuid)`, and `DeleteAllByUUID(uuid)` for admin cleanup.
- DTO shapes
  - API `cluster.Node`: `uuid` (required) first, `clientId` optional. `database` includes `driver`.
  - Registry `Node`: mirrors the API shape; `ClientID` optional.
- DTO fields are normalized:
  - `database` (not `db`) with fields `name`, `user`, `driver`, `rotatedAt`.
  - Node rotation timestamps use `rotatedAt`.
  - Registration secrets expose `clientSecret` in API responses; the CLI persists it into config options as `NodeClientSecret`.
  - Admin responses may include `advertiseUrl` and `database`; non-admin responses are redacted by default.
- CLI
  - Resolution order is `uuid → clientId → name`. `nodes rm` supports `--all-ids` to delete all client rows that share a UUID. Tables include a “DB Driver” column.
- Provisioner
  - DB/user names are UUID‑based without slugs: `photoprism_d<hmac11>`, `photoprism_u<hmac11>`. HMAC is scoped by ClusterUUID+NodeUUID.
  - BuildDSN accepts `driver`; unsupported values fall back to MySQL format with a warning.
- ClientData cleanup
  - `NodeUUID` removed from `ClientData`; it lives on the top‑level client row (`auth_clients.node_uuid`). `ClientDatabase` now includes `driver`.
- Testing patterns:
  - Use `httptest` for Portal endpoints and `pkg/fs.Unzip` with size caps for extraction tests.
